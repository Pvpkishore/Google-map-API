    You can do this by simply double-clicking the file or using a local server if you prefer.

## Google Maps API Key

To use the Google Maps API, you need a valid API key. Follow these steps to get your API key:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Navigate to the **API & Services** > **Credentials** page.
4. Click on **Create Credentials** and select **API key**.
5. Restrict your API key as needed and copy it.

Add your API key to the `script.js` file or include it in your configuration as shown below:

```javascript
function initMap() {
    var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {
        center: {lat: -34.397, lng: 150.644},
        zoom: 8
    });
    // Your other map code here
}
```

Include the API key in your HTML file within the `<script>` tag:

```html
<script async defer
src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initMap">
</script>
```

## Usage

- Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the map.
- Customize the map by modifying `script.js` and `styles.css`.
- Use the Google Maps JavaScript API documentation to explore additional features and customization options.

## Files

- `index.html` - The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the page.
- `styles.css` - Contains the CSS styles for the application.
- `script.js` - Contains JavaScript code to initialize and interact with Google Maps.
